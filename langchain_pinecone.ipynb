His wife played a significant role in his career progress and development of perspective in strategy. He was captured by the French during the Napoleonic war, and after his release, he joined the Russian army and fought against Napoleon. He attempted to finish a book titled \"On War\" but died of Cholera before he could complete it. His perspectives on war and strategy are still influential today.'"
